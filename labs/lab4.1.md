# Lab 4.1 | File Globing/wildcards

> **Note:** This is part of lab 4 but because historically students have had issues grabbing the concept of wildcards, I decided to make it a stand alone lab. 


## Question 1 | Using the * Wildcard

## Question 2 | Using the ? wildcard

## Question 3 | Using the [] Wildcard

## Question 4 | Using brace expansion.
