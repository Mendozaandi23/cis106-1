# Lab 6 | Using VIM

> **NOTE:** You do not need to be a pro using VIM you do not plan to use it a a development environment. However, you do need 
> to know the following things relatively well for your day to day work as a Linux User.
> * Opening a file
> * Saving a file and saving as another name
> * Editing a file (working with vim multiple modes)
> * Replacing text
> * Vim search tools
> Vim does a lot more than that, to a degree that a lot of Developers prefer to write code on VIM because its keyboard centric approach is a productivity enhancer. Once you learn VIM, you will hate every other text editor.~~~~
