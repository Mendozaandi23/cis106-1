## What markdown isn't
* Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, In the word of its author:
> Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a publishing format; Markdown is a writing format. Thus, Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.

## Formatting in Markdown

* **Headings**
To write heading start with the `#` sign. For example:
This is heading 1: `# Potatoes`
This is heading 2: `## Potatoes 2`
This is heading 3: `### Potatoes 3`
Noticed that the number of `#` indicates the type of heading.
This is the equivalent of the `<h#></h#>` HTML tag.
* **Bold**
To bold any word soround the word with double `*` or double  `_`.
For example:
  * `The cat **eats** the food`
  * `The dog __plays__ with the food`
This will render:
  * The cat **eats** the food
  * The dog __plays__ with the food
* Italics
For italics use a single `*` or `_`
For example:
  * `The cat *eats* the food`
  * `The dog _plays_ with the food`
This will render:
  * The cat *eats* the food
  * The dog _plays_ with the food

* Strike through
For strike through use double tilde `~~` character:
For example:
  * `The cat ~~eats~~ plays the food`
  * `The dog ~~plays~~ eats with the food`
This will render:
  * The cat ~~eats~~ plays the food
  * The dog ~~plays~~ eats with the food

### Working with lists

* **Ordered List**
For order list, start with the number and a period. For example:
This:
```
1. Pets
    1. Dog
    2. Cat
    3. Parrot
2. Food
    1. Hamburger
    2. Pizza
    3. Pasta
3. Jobs
    1. Programmer
    2. Engineer
    3. Administrator
```
Will render like this:
1. Pets
    1. Dog
    2. Cat
    3. Parrot
2. Food
    1. Hamburger
    2. Pizza
    3. Pasta
3. Jobs
    1. Programmer
    2. Engineer
    3. Administrator

* **Unordered List**
To create unordered lists, use a single `*`, `+`, or `-` characters followed by a space. For example:
This
```
* List of Pets
    + Dog
      + Pitbull
    + Cat
      + Persian
    + Parrot
      + Cockatiel
```
Will render like this:
* List of Pets
    + Dog
      + Pitbull
    + Cat
      + Persian
    + Parrot
      + Cockatiel

Notice that the regardless of the symbol used, the rendering was the same.
