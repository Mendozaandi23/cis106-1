# Managing files and directories:

1. Create a directory called `books` in your `~/Documents` directory.
2. Inside the `books` directory, create 3 directories called:
   1. `action`
   2. `adventure`
   3. `fantasy`
3. Change your current working directory to `/var`. Create the following directory structure in your `~/Videos` directory:
```
movies/
├── animated
├── historical fiction
└── mystery
```
4. In your `$HOME` directory create the following directory structure using a single command:
```
practice1/
└── foods
    └── american
        └── burgers
```
5. Create a file inside each book category directory. Use any name you want for the file:
```
books/
├── action
├── adventure
└── fantasy
```
6. Create a file inside the burgers directory. The file must have a space or special character in its name:
7. Display a tree of the `books` directory.
8. List all the files in the practice1 directory recursively with human readable file sizes.
9. Use the rm command to delete all the files and directories that you have created so far.
## Lets practice copying and moving files. 
First lets generate some files to work with:
- Run this command `curl https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes > ~/Downloads/randomquote.txt`
- Download an image from the internet. Use this website: https://unsplash.com/wallpapers 
- Download an audio file from the internet. Use this website https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/2
- Download a video file from the internet. Use this website: https://pixabay.com/videos/

1. List all the files in your `~/Downloads` directory. Do you see all the files that you downloaded? Which one is the biggest file? What command did you use to figure it out?
2. Create the necessary directories to start practicing:
 - In your `~/Documents` directory create a directory called: `quote`.
 - In your `~/Pictures` directory create a directory called: `imgs`
 - In your `~/Music` directory create a directory called: `audio`
 - In your `~/Videos` directory create a directory called: `vids`
3. Rename the files you downloaded. Use any naming convention you want.
4. Move the files to their respective directories.
5. Create a new directory called `website` and copy all the files to the website directory.
