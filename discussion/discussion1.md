From the [Github README.md file](https://github.com/ra559/cis106#final-project), download the book The Linux Command Line by William Shotts. Read the story in the Introduction on page xvi. In a short paragraph, introduce yourself and answer the following questions:

1. What do you think the author means when he says: 
**“Freedom is a computer that is without secrets, one where everything can be known if you care enough to find out.”**
Do you agree with the author’s idea that people should be allowed to study/research/thinker with the software they run on their computers?
